            <li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tsp yellow mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <strong><p>Toppings:</p></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>4 burgers buns</li>
            <li>2 cups iceberg lettuce, shredded</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion, sliced into thin rings</li>
            <li>2 Dill Pickles, cut into 12 slices</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <strong><p>Portion Beef Patties:</p></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide beef into 8 even portions, about 3 oz each. Loosely Roll them into balls then 
                cover and refrigerate while preparing remaining ingredients. The meat must be cold 
                when it hits the grill.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong><p>Prep Toppings and Buns:</p></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove wilted leaves from lettuce to keep it crunchy then finely shred lettuce.
                Slice tomatoes, onions, and pickles.
            </li>
            <li>Butter and toast buns over medium heat until golden on the buttered side.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong><p>Cook the Patties:</p></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Increase griddle to medium/high heat. Place 2-4 burger balls onto hot griddle. Working
                quickly, place parchment paper over the meat and firmly smash straight down into a thin patty.
            </li>
            <li>Once patties are smashed, peel back and discard parchment papers and season patties with
                salt, pepper and garlic powder. Add 1/2 teaspoon of burger sauce. Cook 2 minutes on the first 
                side or until seared and juices start to come to the surface.
            </li>
            <li>Scrape under the burger with spatula facing down at a 45Ëš angle to get under the 
                caramelized part and flip. Cook another 1 minute. Top half of the patties with sliced cheese and
                cover cheese with the second patty. Repeat with remaining burgers and transfer them to a platter
                as they finish cooking.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <strong><p>Assemble Burgers:</p></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Place sauce on bottom of bun. Top with 3 pickle slices, shredded lettuce, 2 tomato slices
                and thin sliced onion. Add double patty and top with bun.
            </li>
        </ol>
