        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken tenders when done right are easily one of the most delicious foods 
            that you can possibly make.  As a kid I enjoyed going to the Bronx Zoo not only 
            because of my love for animals, but also because of their AMAZING CHICKEN 
            TENDERS!! However, the prices have grown significantly, which has prompted me to 
            try and experiment with ways to make my homeade chicken recipes taste as good as those
            at the Zoo. Turns out, I have found a way to make them even better! They are crunchy but 
            juicy on the inside, and did I mention how ridiculously easy they are to make?! You won't ever
            want to eat chicken tenders any other way after trying this recipe, and thats a promise</p>
